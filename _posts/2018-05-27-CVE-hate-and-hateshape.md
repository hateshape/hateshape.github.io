So hateshape huh? So you people don't think I hate you (and I might now after requiring that I have to explain myself), the following is the origin that is hateshape.

0. This origin requires that we turn to an obvious source to understand why. The Drew Carey Show. 
1. In one episode, there was a plot where Drew had to pass an insurance physical or be fired.
2. He didn’t think he could pass it, so he tagged in his buddy Lewis.
3. Plot twist: The physical included a Mental Health screening and Lewis is not quite all there upstairs.
4. Lewis answered the questions how he thought Drew would answer them
5. When asked to “Describe Himself” he wrote “Hatred Shaped Like a Man” 
6. This was funny to me so I went with as username until I had to type that twice. so I shortened it
7. At this point it is too late to change it. So hateshape.

Luckily, from a recent slide deck I have this handy visual aid.
